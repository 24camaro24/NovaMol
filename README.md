NovaMol is an advanced machine learning pipeline that combines **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for property prediction and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for molecule generation. It is designed to accelerate *de novo* drug discovery by exploring novel chemical space and providing instant analysis of generated molecules.

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Generative Chemistry:** Utilizes an LSTM-based RNN to learn the language of molecular structures and generate novel, chemically valid molecules in SMILES format.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Employs a powerful Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict critical molecular properties directly from the graph structure of a molecule.
* **Targeted Discovery:** Can be trained on specific biological targets (e.g., EGFR for lung cancer) to generate and evaluate molecules with a higher probability of being effective.
* **Comprehensive Analysis:** Automatically calculates a suite of drug-likeness properties for each generated molecule, including TPSA, QED, SA Score, and Fsp3.
* **Novelty Verification:** Checks generated molecules against the massive PubChem database to distinguish between known compounds and truly novel discoveries.

## 📊 Project Workflow & Results

The NovaMol pipeline executes a complete, end-to-end drug discovery workflow, from training to validation, resulting in a ranked list of promising and novel drug candidates.

*A sample run showing model training and real-time analysis.*

Our validation shows that the GNN can predict key properties with high accuracy, and the RNN is capable of generating a significant number of truly novel molecules.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

This project is built as a Streamlit web application for an interactive, user-friendly experience.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/novamol-drug-discovery.git](https://github.com/yourusername/novamol-drug-discovery.git)
cd novamol-drug-discovery
````

### 2\. Set Up Environment

It is recommended to use a Conda environment.

```bash
# Create and activate the environment
conda create -n novamol python=3.10
conda activate novamol

# Install RDKit (required first)
conda install -c conda-forge rdkit

# Install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt -f [https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-$(python](https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-$(python) -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)").html
```

### 3\. Run the Application

Launch the Streamlit web server. Your browser will automatically open to the landing page.

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

Navigate to the "Launch NovaMol App" page from the sidebar to start using the tool.

## 🔮 Future Work

  * **Expand Predictive Capabilities:** Train the GNN to predict a wider range of ADME/Tox properties (e.g., hERG inhibition, Blood-Brain Barrier penetration).
  * **Advanced Generative Models:** Explore more advanced generative architectures like Transformers or Flow-based models for molecule generation.
  * **Real-time 3D Visualization:** Integrate a 3D molecule viewer (like Py3Dmol) directly into the Streamlit app to visualize the generated candidates.

-----

## 📚 Key Technologies

  * **PyTorch & PyTorch Geometric:** For building and training the GNN and RNN models.
  * **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web application and user interface.
  * **RDKit:** For all chemical informatics tasks, including fingerprinting and property calculation.
  * **ChEMBL & PubChem:** As primary data sources for training and validation.
